# ESP_SSD1306
SSD1306 display library for the ESP8266 board (modified from Adafruit_SSD1306 https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)

This ESP_SSD1306 library is a copy of the Adafruit_SSD1306 library with some modifications in order to work with the ESP8266 board.

This library is intended to be used with the Arduino IDE from https://github.com/esp8266/arduino which supports ESP8266 boards.

Place the ESP_SSD1306 library folder to your /libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.

You will also have to download the Adafruit GFX Graphics core which does all the circles, text, rectangles, etc. You can get it from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library and download/install that library as well 


Follows original README.txt from Adafruit
